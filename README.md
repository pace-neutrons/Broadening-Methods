# Broadening Methods

This repository currently contains exploratory work for finding an optimised approach to adaptive broadening

The repo is structured as follows:
- Analysis of Interpolate Method: Scripts for analysing error/parameter choices in the exsiting
'interpolate' scheme implemented in Abins.
- Compare Schemes: Functions to import either real or synthetic data and apply different broadening schemes to the data.
- Data: Folder containing example real data.
- Method Development: Scripts looking at testing/developing alternative approaches to applying broadening.
